## Agenda 

- "***Computation Is Not Decision Making***"

<div style="color:darkblue;margin:20px;margin-top:50px;" >

  + We need to ask the right questions of our data for our models to add the most business value

</div>
  
- "***Visualization is our most powerful tool***"

<div style="color:darkblue;margin:20px;margin-top:50px;" >

  + We can surface actionable insights and areas of greatest impact by exploring relationships in our data
  
</div>
  
- "***Sizing supports our stakeholders***"

<div style="color:darkblue;margin:20px;margin-top:50px;" >

  + Uncovering the drivers of our business problem will inform necessary partnerships for action
  
</div>
  
## Computation Is Not Decision Making (1)

### Improving business decisions

<div style="color:darkred;margin:20px;margin-top:50px;" >

Using data effectively requires <b>both data and domain knowledge</b> (one will not suffice).

</div>


<p style="margin:10px;font-size:70%;">
<i> -- click "S" to view speaker notes </i> 
</p>

<aside class="notes">

It's assumed that you know about your products/services, the competition, and your customers. In order to use data to improve decision-making, you'll need to understand how to properly leverage what you already know about a topic (i.e. the domain knowledge). Computers can run models, but they can't tell you what's important.

The key to using data successfully is 1) finding the right data and 2) knowing what attributes are important to your business.

If the right data are being measudarkred, and we can clearly define the problem, then data science can help.

</aside>

## Computation Is Not Decision Making (2)

### Set the stage 

<div style="color:darkred;margin:20px;margin-top:50px;" >

Be able to articulate, <b>“what problem are we facing?”</b>

</div>

<p style="margin:10px;font-size:70%;">
<i> -- click "S" to view speaker notes </i> 
</p>

<aside class="notes">

What decision needs to be made? What problem needs to be figudarkred out? What numbers need to be calculated?  What is the "main thing"? Is it to darkreduce acquisition costs, increasing engagement, etc.? Remember, the main thing is to keep the main thing the main thing.

</aside>

## Computation Is Not Decision Making (3)

### Know the characters in the story

<div style="color:darkred;margin:20px;margin-top:50px;" >

Understand what's been measudarkred, i.e. <b>“what are the data?”</b>

</div>

<p style="margin:10px;font-size:70%;">
<i> -- click "S" to view speaker notes </i> 
</p>

<aside class="notes">

What have we measudarkred? What still needs to be measudarkred? What can we do with the data we have? What new data will we need when we've used everything we have?

Are you looking for answers based on the data you have, or based on the problem/question? It is possible that the important question you’re facing can’t be answedarkred with the data you have (this just means the new problem becomes, "how to collect the data you need?")

</aside>


## Computation Is Not Decision Making (4)

### Connect the business problem to a measurable objective

<div style="color:darkred;margin:20px;margin-top:50px;" >

The hardest part of data science is translating a problem into a question that data can answer (and then finding those data).

Example measurable objective: <b>“Identify pdarkredictors for customer churn.”</b>

</div>

<p style="margin:10px;font-size:70%;">

Other examples: 

Did our recent marketing campaign improve customer engagement?  
Have this customer’s buying patterns changed? If so, how?  
How does the location of our products affect purchasing behaviors?  
Who should we target with our new product/service?  

The hardest part of using data to solve problems is asking questions in a way that a computer can answer them. We need to ask the question in a way where we can leverage the power of computation--this means fitting our objectives into a series of steps that a computer can execute.

## Visualizing the process (1)

<div style="color:darkred;margin:20px;margin-top:50px;" >
***Step 1: Look at your data***
</div>

<img src="figs/03-eda-01.png">

<aside class="notes">

Before making any calculations, creating any charts, or running any models, make sure you’ve taken the time to look at the raw data. Open it in a spreadsheet, look at the columns and rows. This will give you a mental model going forward of what you’re dealing with. 

</aside>


## Visualizing the process (2)

<div style="color:darkblue;margin:20px;margin-top:50px;" >
*Step 1: Look at your data*
</div>

<div style="color:darkred;margin:20px;margin-top:50px;" >
***Step 2: Get some numbers***
</div>

<img src="figs/03-eda-02.png">

<aside class="notes">

The second step is to calculate some summary statistics about these data. Means, medians, standard deviations, minimums, maximums, etc. These give us something to think about and equips us with some language for describing the measurements (i.e. “our average customer tenure is…”).

</aside>


## Visualizing the process (3)

<div style="color:darkblue;margin:20px;margin-top:50px;" >
*Step 1: Look at your data*
</div>

<div style="color:darkblue;margin:20px;margin-top:50px;" >
*Step 2: Get some numbers*
</div>

<div style="color:darkred;margin:20px;margin-top:50px;" >
***Step 3: Make a graph***
</div>

<img src="figs/03-eda-03.png">

<aside class="notes">

The third step is to create visualizations for the data. This is the most important step, because visualization is an essentially human activity. A computer can’t interpret a graph, or be surprised by it. Pictures and images are how humans make sense of complex systems. Data are too complicated to be understood as bits of information in a spreadsheet--leave that to the computer. Get comfortable exploring the relationships between measurements using data visualizations.

The goal is to create graphics that are so clear and convincing, that ML/AI becomes just a confirmation of what has already been seen.

</aside>

## Visualize Your Hypotheses

<div style="color:darkblue;margin:20px;margin-top:50px;" >

1. Exploratory data analysis quickly empowers ***discovery*** and ***insights***

2. We should be able to connect an insight with a mechanism for validation

3. Customer segmentation can help us identify who is impacted most 

</div>

<aside class="notes">

Visualizations should be informed by domain knowledge to capture potential areas of opportunity 

For customer churn, it will be important to know where in the customer lifecycle are customers at the greatest risk of cancelling

</aside>

## Visualize Your Hypotheses

<div style="color:darkred;margin:20px;margin-top:50px;" >

Customer churn is greatest among customers within the first 20 months of purchasing


<img src="figs/04-viz-01.png" width='55%' height='55%'>

<aside class="notes">

~60% of customers cancel within the first month compadarkred with ~ 30% at month 12

With this data we can’t say how long we can expect a customer to stay if they don’t cancel within the first year, however,

We can say that overall customers who pay for 12 months are at only half the risk of cancelling

</aside>

## Visualize Your Hypotheses 

<div style="color:darkred;margin:20px;margin-top:50px;" >

Customers paying by electronic check are more than 2X as likely to churn as other payment types. 

</div>

<img src="figs/04-viz-02.png" width='70%' height='70%'>

<aside class="notes">

Visualizations should be informed by domain knowledge to capture potential areas of opportunity 

</aside>

## Visualize Your Hypotheses 

<div style="color:darkred;margin:20px;margin-top:50px;" >

Payment type impacts customer segments differently

<img src="figs/04-viz-03.png" width='70%' height='70%'>


<aside class="notes">

The greatest gap in churn exists between seniors and non-seniors paying by mailed check

Why would this impact seniors? Mailing requires repeating and memorizing an event.

</aside>

## Visualize Your Hypotheses 

<div style="color:darkred;margin:20px;margin-top:50px;" >

Paperless Billing appears to be associated with higher churn agnostic of product type. 

<img src="figs/04-viz-04.png" width='70%' height='70%'>

<aside class="notes">

What about paperless billing might impact churn? Paperless customers may see viewer statements and the service may lose a top of find touch point.

</aside>

## Sizing supports our stakeholders 

<div style="color:darkblue;margin:20px;margin-top:50px;" >

Learnings: 

1. Early life customers are at the greatest risk of churn 

2. Payment method and billing are associated with increased churn risk 

3. Customer segmentation reveals specific opportunities in the data
